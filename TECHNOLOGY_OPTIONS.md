**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem than Kafka
- Less enterprise adoption
- Fewer monitoring tools

### Redis Streams
**Pros:**
- Already might have Redis

## 4. Storage Strategy

### Option A: Single PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB
- Simple deployment
- Continuous aggregates for pre-computed metrics
- Retention policies for old data

### Option B: Hot/Cold Architecture
- **Hot**: PostgreSQL/Redis for recent data (7-30 days)
- **Cold**: Parquet files + DuckDB for historical queries
- Background job to move data to cold storage

### Option C: Pure Columnar
- ClickHouse or DuckDB only
- Optimized for analytics from the start

---

## 5. Testing Frameworks

### Python (pytest)
**Pros:**
- Excellent test discovery
- Rich plugin ecosystem (pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov)
- Fixtures system
- Easy to mock

### Rust (cargo test)
**Pros:**
- Fast execution

- Traces + Metrics + Logs
- Future-proof

**Cons:**
- More complex setup

### Simple: Structured JSON Logs + python-json-logger / structlog

## Recommended Stack (My Suggestion)

### Primary Recommendation:
```
Language: Python 3.11+
Web Framework: FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL 15 + TimescaleDB extension
New Tool: DuckDB (for hot/cold storage layer)
Queue (optional): NATS JetStream
Caching: Redis (for idempotency + rate limiting)
Testing: pytest + httpx
Observability: structlog + prometheus-client
Container: Docker + docker-compose
```

**Why This Stack:**

1. **FastAPI**: Fast, async, great validation, rapid development
2. **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB**: Mature, handles time-series, JSONB for properties, excellent indexing
3. **DuckDB**: NEW TOOL - can be used for:
   - Querying cold storage (Parquet files)
   - Fast ad-hoc analytics
   - Data export/import operations
4. **NATS JetStream**: Lightweight queue for async ingestion (optional)
5. **Redis**: Fast idempotency checks, rate limiting
6. **Balance**: Production-ready + learning opportunity

---

## Alternative Stack (More Cutting Edge):

```
Language: Rust
Web Framework: Axum
Database: ClickHouse
New Tool: NATS JetStream
Testing: cargo test + integration tests
Observability: tracing + metrics
```

**Why:**
- Maximum performance
- Learn modern Rust ecosystem
- ClickHouse optimized for analytics

**Trade-off:**
- Longer development time
- Steeper learning curve
- Less flexible for rapid iteration

---

## Next Steps:

1. **Decide on primary language** (Python vs Rust vs Go)
2. **Choose database strategy** (TimescaleDB vs ClickHouse vs DuckDB vs Hybrid)
3. **Pick "new tool"** (DuckDB, NATS, ClickHouse, or something else)
4. **Define architecture** in ADR.md
5. **Start with docker-compose setup**
