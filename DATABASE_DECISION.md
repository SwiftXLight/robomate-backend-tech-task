# Database Strategy Decision

## Quick Comparison for Your Task

### Option A: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB Only
```
FastAPI → PostgreSQL+TimescaleDB (with JSONB for properties)
         ↓
      Redis (idempotency cache)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple architecture, one database
- ✅ ACID transactions for event ingestion
- ✅ TimescaleDB hypertables automatically partition by time
- ✅ Continuous aggregates for pre-computed DAU/stats
- ✅ JSONB indexing (GIN) for properties queries
- ✅ Mature, production-ready
- ✅ Easy to test and benchmark
- ✅ Good enough for 100k+ events

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not learning a "new" tool (requirement says pick something new)
- ❌ Write performance slightly lower than columnar DBs
- ❌ Less impressive architecturally

**Best for:** Getting it done quickly, ensuring stability

### Option B: TimescaleDB + DuckDB (Hot/Cold Architecture)
```
FastAPI → NATS → Worker → TimescaleDB (hot, last 30 days)
                              ↓
                         Background Job
                              ↓
                    Export to Parquet (cold storage)
                              ↓
                    DuckDB queries cold data
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Learn DuckDB (NEW TOOL requirement!)
- ✅ Shows architectural sophistication
- ✅ Cost-effective for historical data (Parquet is compressed)
- ✅ DuckDB is FAST for analytics on cold data
- ✅ Can query Parquet directly without loading
- ✅ TimescaleDB handles real-time well
- ✅ Impressive for interview

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex to implement
- ❌ Need data migration logic
- ❌ Query logic needs to check both hot/cold
- ❌ More testing required
- ❌ Takes longer to build

**Best for:** Showing advanced skills, learning DuckDB

---

### Option C: DuckDB Only
```
FastAPI → NATS → Worker → DuckDB
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Learn DuckDB (NEW!)
- ✅ Extremely fast analytics
- ✅ Simple deployment (embedded)
- ✅ Can export to Parquet easily
- ✅ Great for read-heavy analytics

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Single writer limitation** (can be issue with concurrent ingestion)
- ❌ Less mature for high-write scenarios
- ❌ No built-in replication
- ❌ Idempotency checking might be slower
- ❌ Risky for production-like system

**Best for:** Read-heavy, lower concurrency scenarios

---

### Option D: ClickHouse Only
```
FastAPI → NATS → Worker → ClickHouse
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Built for this exact use case (event analytics)
- ✅ Extremely fast writes and reads
- ✅ Excellent compression
- ✅ Learn something new
- ✅ Industry-standard for analytics

**Cons:**
- ❌ No transactions (eventual consistency)
- ❌ Updates are slow (need to handle idempotency carefully)
- ❌ More complex to run (needs more resources)
- ❌ Steeper learning curve

**Best for:** Maximum performance at scale

## My Recommendation: **Option B** (TimescaleDB + DuckDB)

### Why:
1. **Meets "new tool" requirement** - You'll learn DuckDB properly
2. **Shows architectural thinking** - Hot/cold pattern is real-world solution
3. **Balances risk** - TimescaleDB handles writes reliably, DuckDB shines on analytics
4. **Great talking points** - You can discuss trade-offs in interview
5. **Performance story** - Can show how cold storage reduces costs
6. **Not too complex** - Can start with TimescaleDB, add DuckDB layer later

### Implementation Path:
1. **Phase 1** (MVP): Start with TimescaleDB only
   - Get event ingestion working
   - Implement all analytics queries
   - Add tests and benchmarking

2. **Phase 2** (Enhancement): Add DuckDB layer
   - Background job to export old data to Parquet
   - DuckDB queries for historical analysis
   - Update query logic to check both sources

### Simplified Alternative: **Option A** (TimescaleDB only)

If time is limited or you want to focus on other aspects (NATS, observability, tests), going with TimescaleDB alone is totally fine. It meets all requirements and you can say **NATS JetStream** is your new tool.

## Final Stack Recommendation:

```
Language: Python 3.11+
Framework: FastAPI
Database (Hot): PostgreSQL 15 + TimescaleDB
Database (Cold): DuckDB + Parquet files
Queue: NATS JetStream (NEW TOOL #1)
Cache: Redis (idempotency + rate limiting)
Testing: pytest + pytest-asyncio + httpx
Observability: structlog + prometheus-client
Container: Docker + docker-compose
```

OR if simpler:

```
Language: Python 3.11+
Framework: FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL 15 + TimescaleDB
Queue: NATS JetStream (NEW TOOL)
Cache: Redis (idempotency + rate limiting)
Testing: pytest + pytest-asyncio + httpx
Observability: structlog + prometheus-client
Container: Docker + docker-compose
```

Both are great options! The question is: do you want to showcase **architectural sophistication** (hot/cold) or focus on **solid execution** (single DB)?
